## Public accessible methods
This section explains all public accessible methods, especially what they do, how to call them and when using them might be advantageous instead of other methods. We always assume AudioManager instance has been already referenced in the script. If you haven't done that already see [Reference to Audio Manager Script](https://mathewhdyt.github.io/Unity-Audio-Manager/installation#reference-to-audio-manager-script).
