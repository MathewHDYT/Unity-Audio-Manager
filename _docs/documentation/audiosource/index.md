## AudioSource API
All public accessible methods below communicate and depend on the [```AudioSource```](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html) API. This API is used because it is the primary way to play audio files in Unity and a lot of methods rely on underlying [```AudioSource```](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.html) API calls. If a documentation of the underlying API call exists it is added in the given method description.
