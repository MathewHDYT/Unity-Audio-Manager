## Contributing
If additional features or requests (enhancement) are wanted or if a bug is found an issue can be created. The topic and text should be descriptive tough and contain if possible:

#### Enhancement
- How the new functionality should work?
- What the new functionality should do?
- Why the new functionality is needed?


#### Bug
- How the bug was created?
- Which method was used in the AudioManager?
- What AudioError Enum result the method returned?

If you want to implement a feature or request (enhancement) or fix a bug yourself you are free to fork the repository and create a new branch for the bug or feature, see the recommended branch names can be found below, and push the branch once finished. I will then integrate it into the main AudioManager as soon as possible.

#### Enhancement
```feat_<enhancement_name>```


#### Bug
```bug_<bug_name>```
